## Description

[Porto Seguro](https://www.portoseguro.com.br/en/institutional) is one of the largest insurance companies in Brazil specialized in car and home insurance. Located in São Paulo, Porto Seguro has been one of the leading insurers in Brazil since its foundation in 1945.

A key challenge faced by all major insurers is, when it comes to car insurance, how to address fairness towards good drivers and try not to penalize those who have a good driving history on account of a few bad drivers. Inaccuracies in car insurance claim predictions usually raise its cost for good drivers and reduce the price for bad ones.

In this [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/porto-seguro-safe-driver-prediction/), the challenge is to build a model that predicts the probability that a car insurance policyholder will file a claim next year.
